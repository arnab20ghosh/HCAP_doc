# <a id="api" name="api"></a>Deploy Accelerator API Reference

Hitachi Cloud Accelerator Platform - Deploy (Deploy Accelerator) provides a set of APIs (Application Programming Interface) for various components such as environments, providers, connections, resources, and more. For example, you can use the Environment APIs to get a list of all user environments, save and update environments, and share all versions of an environment based on the assigned permissions.<br>

The API Reference is organized by components and provides information about the method, syntax, parameters, and response code for each API.<br>
