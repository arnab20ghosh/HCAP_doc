Hitachi Cloud Accelerator Platform - Deploy (Deploy Accelerator) is a deployment automation platform that is used to deploy and configure environments reliably and consistently. Installation that used to take weeks can now happen in hours. It supports many cloud providers out-of-the-box, including Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Deploy Accelerator also supports parallel deployments and leverages all the major infrastructure automation tools such as Chef (Chef Server and Chef Solo), Ansible Solo, and Puppet.<br>

Deploy Accelerator can be deployed in the online or offline mode based on your requirements. In the offline mode, Deploy Accelerator does not require Internet connectivity to perform various operations. All required artifacts are accessed from the Artifactory that is configured while deploying Deploy Accelerator.<br>
