| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Why am I not able to delete a group?                         | Confirm that the group you are trying to delete does not have any members. You can delete a group only if no users are assigned to that group. |
| Can there be multiple administrators in Cloud Accelerator Platform? | When Cloud Accelerator Platform is successfully deployed, a Cloud Accelerator Platform administrator can sign in with the credentials mentioned in **customer.yml** file at the time of deployment. If required, this administrator can create additional Cloud Accelerator Platform administrators by assigning other users to the appropriate group. |
| Can administrators change the access level for users who have created their own Cloud Accelerator Platform account? | Policies defined for a group control the operations that group members can perform in Cloud Accelerator Platform. The Cloud Accelerator Platform administrator can change the DEFAULT group that is assigned to users who have created their own account.  For more information about configuring access level for users, see <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-platform-common', viewPage: 'administer', viewSection: 'groups'})" style="text-decoration:none">managing groups</a> and <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-platform-common', viewPage: 'administer', viewSection: 'users'})" style="text-decoration:none">managing users</a>. |
| Can I create a group of users who can view each others resources? | Yes, you can create a group, add users to this group, and configure share permissions for specific resources. Users within the group can view each other's resources and perform other actions based on the assigned share permissions.<br><br>However, the users within this group must also be a part of another group that contains appropriate policies to perform the selected actions on the shared resources. For example, to view each other's manual test jobs, users must also be assigned to another policy-based group that gives them the basic permission to view manual test jobs.<br><br>You can currently configure share permissions for only Test Accelerator resources. For more information, see <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-platform-common', viewPage: 'administer', viewSection: 'groups'})" style="text-decoration:none">managing groups</a>. |
| Can I integrate Cloud Accelerator Platform with Microsoft Active Directory for authentication and authorization? | Yes, Cloud Accelerator Platform enables you to use your existing Microsoft Active Directory setup to authenticate users in Cloud Accelerator Platform and provide user-group authorization. You can integrate Cloud Accelerator Platform with only one setup of Active Directory.<br><br>For more information, see <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-platform-common', viewPage: 'administer', viewSection: 'active'})" style="text-decoration:none">Integrating Cloud Accelerator Platform with Active Directory</a>. |

Map at least one Active Directory group to the ADMIN group in Cloud Accelerator Platform. This Active Directory group must contain users who must be given administrative permissions in Cloud Accelerator Platform. |
| Can existing users continue to access Cloud Accelerator Platform after the integration with Active Directory? | After the Active Directory integration is completed, existing users and administrators cannot sign in to Cloud Accelerator Platform with their original credentials. Cloud Accelerator Platform now uses Active Directory to authenticate users.<br><br>Existing users can sign in to Cloud Accelerator Platform only if they are a member of integrated Active Directory. These users need to sign in with their Active Directory email ID and password. The users can view their existing data in Cloud Accelerator Platform only if their Active Directory email ID is same as the email ID they used to log in to the Platform before the integration with Active Directory. This lets the Platform identify the data (environments, deployments, etc.) ownership correctly. |
| Why are administrators not able to log in to Cloud Accelerator Platform after the integration with Active Directory? | After the <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-platform-common', viewPage: 'administer', viewSection: 'active'})" style="text-decoration:none">Active Directory integration</a> is completed, Cloud Accelerator Platform uses Active Directory to authenticate users. Therefore, existing administrators are not able to sign in to Cloud Accelerator Platform.<br><br>While configuring the Active Directory integration, at least one Active Directory group must be mapped to the ADMIN group in Cloud Accelerator Platform. This ensures that users who are members of this Active Directory group can access the Admin Console. |
| Is it possible to manage users in Cloud Accelerator Platform after the integration with Active Directory? | No, it is not possible to add or manage users in Cloud Accelerator Platform after the integration with Active Directory. You can only view user details in the Admin Console. |
| Can I view a list of Active Directory users in Cloud Accelerator Platform? | After the Active Directory integration is completed, you can only view user details in the Admin Console but you must create and manage users in Active Directory. |
| How can I add new users in Cloud Accelerator Platform after the integration with Active Directory? | After Cloud Accelerator Platform is integrated with Active Directory, an Administrator user in the integrated Active Directory can add new users in Active Directory.<br><br>Once the new users are created in Active Directory, these users can log in to Cloud Accelerator Platform with their Active Directory credentials. |
| Is it possible to create new groups in Cloud Accelerator Platform after the integration with Active Directory? | Yes, you can <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-platform-common', viewPage: 'administer', viewSection: 'groups'})" style="text-decoration:none">create and manage groups</a> in the Admin Console after you have integrated Cloud Accelerator Platform with Active Directory. You must also <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-platform-common', viewPage: 'administer', viewSection: 'groups'})" style="text-decoration:none">map the appropriate Active Directory group to any new group</a> that you create in the Admin Console. |
| How can I map Active Directory users to Cloud Accelerator Platform groups? | After the Active Directory integration is completed, the **Group Mappings** section displays the Active Directory groups based on your configuration. You must map these Active Directory groups to the appropriate Cloud Accelerator Platform groups.

| Question                                                     | Answer                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Can I use Deploy Accelerator  to deploy an application infrastructure that spans multiple cloud providers? | Yes, Deploy Accelerator enables you to deploy an application infrastructure that spans multiple cloud providers. However, each environment in Deploy Accelerator is specific to a single cloud provider. To create an application infrastructure that spans multiple cloud providers, you must <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'environments'})" style="text-decoration:none">create a separate environment</a> for each cloud provider and then create dependencies between these environments.<br><br>For example, you can create an environment for the LDAP infrastructure in a private cloud and create another environment for the web application infrastructure in a public cloud. You can then create a dependency between these two environments.<br><br>For more information, see <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'layered-env'})" style="text-decoration:none">Overview of layered environments</a>. |
| Can I reference environment details from another environment? | You can use the **Depends On** and **Output** resources to refer to values from another environment. For an example, see <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'scenario-layered'})" style="text-decoration:none">Create a layered environment</a>. |
| Can I choose not to display output values in the resource logs of an environment? | To prevent an output value from appearing in the resource logs of an environment, add the **sensitive** parameter for that output in the **Output** resource, as shown in the example below:<br><br>![](platform-common/sensitiveParameter.PNG) |
| Why am I not able to create an environment?                  | When you <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-platform-common', viewPage: 'createAndAccessAccount', viewSection: 'create'})" style="text-decoration:none">create a Cloud Accelerator Platform account</a>, the default group assigned to you does not have the access to create an environment. Contact your Cloud Accelerator Platform administrator and confirm that you have been added to the appropriate group. |
| Can I collaborate with other users on the same environment?  | You can collaborate with other users on an environment by <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'collaboration'})" style="text-decoration:none">sharing that environment</a> with one or more groups. You can also assign each group appropriate permissions such as view, create, edit, deploy, destroy, delete, import and export. All users in that group can work on the shared environment at the same time. |
| Why does the blueprint of a layered environment that I have exported not contain all the environments? | When you <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'export-blueprint'})" style="text-decoration:none">export an environment as a blueprint</a>, only the environments on which it is dependent are included. Therefore, while exporting a layered environment as a blueprint, ensure that you are exporting the environment that is in the lowest layer. This action ensures that the environments in all other layers are also included in the blueprint. |
| Can I find out if an environment has a dependency on other environments? | You can <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'blueprintview'})" style="text-decoration:none">use the Environment Dependency View</a> to view the dependency of an environment on other environments. You can also switch to another environment in the Environment Dependency View window by clicking that environment name. |
| Can I create a new environment version by importing a blueprint? | While <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'blueprint'})" style="text-decoration:none">creating new environments from blueprints</a>, you have to enter a unique combination of name and version for the environment that you are importing. If you enter an existing environment name and a unique version for that environment, the imported environment is added as a version of that existing environment. |
| Why am I not able to delete some environment versions?       | You might not be able to delete a shared environment if the owner has not given you the appropriate permission. If you are not working on a shared environment, confirm whether the environment version that you are trying to delete has any deployments. You cannot delete environment versions that are already deployed. |
| Can I easily identify the differences between two environments? | You can <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'c'})ompare" style="text-decoration:none">compare differences between two environments or two versions of the same environment</a>.

For example, you can specify different VPC IDs for your Staging and Production deployments. |
| Can I view all deployments of an environment?                | If an environment has multiple deployments, you can <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'view-deploy'})" style="text-decoration:none">view the list</a> of all your deployments and other deployments that are shared with you, along with their status.<br><br>The deployments drop-down on the canvas categorizes deployments based on environment versions. By default, the most recent deployment from the list for the selected environment version appears. |
| How can I upgrade an existing deployment of an environment?  | To upgrade an existing deployment, you can <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'redeploy'})" style="text-decoration:none">redeploy the existing deployment</a> with either the same or a different environment version. In this case, only the changes made in the selected environment version are provisioned. Deployed resources that have not been updated in the selected environment version are not impacted.<br><br>You can plan and redeploy an existing deployment that is shared with you only if the deployment owner has given you the **Redeploy** permission for that deployment. |
| Before redeploying an existing deployment of an environment, can I preview the changes that will be made to the existing deployment? | Before you redeploy an existing deployment, you can <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'plan'})" style="text-decoration:none">view the plan</a> that Deploy Accelerator generates. This plan provides a list of resources that will be created, updated, or destroyed when you redeploy the deployment.<br>You can plan and redeploy an existing deployment that is shared with you only if the deployment owner has given you the **Redeploy** permission for that deployment. |
| Can I upgrade a parent deployment without impacting its child deployments? | You can upgrade a parent deployment by <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'redeploy'})" style="text-decoration:none">redeploying that deployment</a> with a new or updated environment version. This action impacts its child deployments only if they reference any updated resource values in the parent deployment. |
| Can I upgrade a child deployment without impacting its parent deployments? | You can upgrade a child deployment without impacting any of its parent deployments. |
| Why am I not able to deploy an environment that uses the S3 reference type in the Depends On resource? | You might not be able to deploy an environment that uses the **S3** reference type in the **Depends On** resource because of the following reasons:<br>-- The provider that you have selected to deploy the environment does not have access to the S3 bucket that you have specified.<br>-- The URL that you have specified does not use the **s3://bucketname/tfstatefilename** format, in which **bucketname** is the name of the S3 bucket and **tfstatefilename** is the Terraform remote state file of the environment that is to be referred.<br>-- If you have defined variables for the S3 bucket and Terraform state file names in the **Input Variables** resource, you have not used the following interpolation syntax to reference these variables:<br>**s3://${var.*bucketNameInputVariable*}/${var.*tfstateFileNameInputVariable*}** |
| Why am I not able to destroy a deployment of an environment? | You might not be able to <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'destroy'})" style="text-decoration:none">destroy a deployment</a> of a shared environment if the owner has not given you the appropriate permission. If you are not working on a shared environment, confirm whether deployments in other environments have a dependency on the deployment that you are trying to destroy. You must destroy the child (or dependent) deployments before you can destroy the parent deployment.<br><br>Also, you can destroy a deployment that is shared with you only if the deployment owner has given you the **Destroy** permission for that deployment. |
| Can I identify deployments that are shared with me?          | Deployments that other users have shared with you appear in a different color in the deployments list on the canvas. |
| Why are users not able to see the deployment that I have shared with their group? | When you <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'deploy-share'})" style="text-decoration:none">share a a deployment</a> of an environment version with selected groups, ensure that the <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'collaboration'})" style="text-decoration:none">environment version is also shared</a>  with the same groups. Otherwise, users cannot view the shared deployments. |
| Why am I not able to redeploy a deployment that is shared with me? | You can <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'redeploy'})" style="text-decoration:none">redeploy a deployment</a> that is shared with you only if the deployment owner has given you the **Redeploy** permission for that deployment.<br><br>In addition, the deployment owner must also share with you the provider that is configured in the shared deployment. |
| Why am I not able to plan a deployment that is shared with me? | You can <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'plan'})" style="text-decoration:none">plan a deployment</a> that is shared with you only if the deployment owner has given you the **Redeploy** permission for that deployment.<br><br>The **Redeploy** permission of a deployment also includes the permission to plan that deployment. |
| Can I share my deployment only if its status is Deployed?    | You can <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'deploy-share'})" style="text-decoration:none">share any of your deployments</a> with other groups, irrespective of the deployment state (Deploying, Deployed, Failed, or Stop state). |
| Why do I get an error message that the deployment name that I have specified is not unique even though I cannot see that deployment name in the list on the canvas? | The name that you specify for a deployment must be unique across all versions of the environment. If another user already has a deployment with the name that you have specified, you get an error message.  However, you can see that deployment name in the list on the canvas only if the deployment and its associated environment version is shared with you. |
| Why are parent deployments not visible when I try to redeploy the child deployment that is shared with me? | While <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'redeploy'})" style="text-decoration:none">redeploying a child deployment</a> that is shared with you, parent deployments are visible in the **Parent Deployment Mapping** section only if the deployment owner has also shared the parent deployments with you.<br><br>If the parent deployments are not visible in the Review and Re-Deploy window, you cannot redeploy the child deployment that is shared with you. |
| When I share some environments, why are all its deployments also automatically shared with the same groups with which the environment is shared? | If you have upgraded from a version earlier than 2.9.0, and you later <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'collaboration'})" style="text-decoration:none">share any environment version</a> that was created before the upgrade, all its deployments are also automatically shared with the same groups with which the environments are shared.

| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Can I define variables that are available for all resources in an environment? | You can use the **Input Variable** resource to define variables that can be used in all other resources in the same environment. For an example, see <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'scenario-input'})" style="text-decoration:none">Configure variables in your environment</a>. |
| Can I rename a resource that has been added to an environment? | You can <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'resource-rename'})" style="text-decoration:none">rename a resource</a> that has been added to an environment. The resource name is automatically updated in other resources within the environment that reference it by using the interpolation syntax or the **Depends On** attribute. |
| Can I create a copy of an existing resource?                 | You can <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'resource-copy'})" style="text-decoration:none">copy an existing resource</a> from either the same environment or a different environment. The attribute values of the new resource are the same as the original resource that you have copied. However, the name attribute value and tags are not copied to the new resource. The packages that were added to the original resource are also copied to the new resource. |
| Can I view the dependencies between various resources in an environment? | You can view the dependencies that are created when resources use the **Depends On** attribute or the interpolation syntax to reference other resources in an environment. To view these dependencies, click the **Links** icon (![](/images/rean-deploy/icon_links.PNG)) on the Deploy Accelerator canvas. |
| Can I create multiple resources based on the same configuration? | You can use the **Count** attribute of a resource to specify the number of identical resources that you want Deploy Accelerator to create while deploying the environment. |
| Can I control access to the AWS resources that are created when I deploy an environment? | To control access to AWS resources in an environment, you can assign tags to the resources. AWS IAM policies can leverage resource tags to define the resources that users can access. Deploy Accelerator simplifies the process of adding common tags to all resources in an environment. You can <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'tags'})" style="text-decoration:none">configure a custom tag</a>, which contains a set of AWS key-pair tags, and select that custom tag while <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-deploy', viewPage: 'deploy-and-manage-environments', viewSection: 'deploy'})" style="text-decoration:none">deploying an environment</a>. |
| Can I provision packages on servers that are not provisioned by using Deploy Accelerator? | You can use the **Existing VM** resource to represent existing servers in an environment.

This chart consists of the following layers:<br>-- The center layer provides a summary of the assessment job. You can see the total number of checks that were run and the number of checks that failed.<br>-- The next layer represents the policies that were run for the selected job. For example, security policy, cost optimization policy, and operations policy.<br>-- The third layer represents different categories of assessment checks within each policy. For example, Security Assessment for Monitoring Compliance is a category of assessment check within the security policy.<br>-- The outermost layer represents each check that is included in a policy. For example, "Ensure no S3 buckets are public" is a specific check within the security policy.<br><br>Click any layer to drill down into a specific set of data. Click the center layer to get back to the previous view. |

| Why do I need to create a provider?                          | Providers enable you to specify the cloud provider and credentials for accessing the account in which Migrate Accelerator must create images of the servers you are migrating.<br><br>When you <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-migrate', viewPage: 'discover-and-migrate-resources', viewSection: 'migrate'})" style="text-decoration:none">start a migration job</a> for a group of servers in the data center, CloudEndure creates test instances in AWS and replicates data from these servers on the test instances. After the data replication has completed successfully, Migrate Accelerator uses the provider that is configured in the migration job to create images of the test instances.<br><br>_**Note:** Migrate Accelerator can create images only in the same AWS account in which CloudEndure launches test instances. Therefore, the provider that you select in a migration job must contain credentials that match the credentials that are specified in the CloudEndure Live Migration project._ |

| Who should use Managed Cloud Services?                      | The Operations Team of a company can use Managed Cloud Services to perform the following actions:<br>-- Assess, audit, and evaluate the configuration of AWS resources<br>-- Gather performance metrics for AWS resources<br>-- Monitor and evaluate security events and costs<br>-- Auto-remediate frequently occurring incidents |
| What are the benefits of using Managed Cloud Services?      | Managed Cloud Services includes multiple sensors (for example, AWS Config and Datadog) that watch for configuration changes and alarms. Managed Cloud Services receives this data from the sensors, processes the data, identifies and performs the appropriate remediation action, and sends a notification to users.<br><br>Managed Cloud Services also provides many out-of-the-box customizable governing rules and enables easy addition of rules based on your requirements. |
| Does Managed Cloud Services have multi-region support?      | Yes, Managed Cloud Services is supported in multiple AWS regions, including the AWS GovCloud. |
| How can Managed Cloud Services help in security compliance? | Managed Cloud Services includes out-of-the-box rules that help in evaluating resources for security compliance. These rules also specify the actions that Managed Cloud Services must take in the case of non-compliant resources. For example, if an instance has multiple open ports that can compromise security, Managed Cloud Services can automatically take this instance offline. |

### <a id="rules-mnc" name="rules-mnc"></a>Rules (Managed Cloud Services)

| Question                                                     | Answer                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| What is a Managed Cloud rule?                                | Each Managed Cloud rule defines a set of conditions that an AWS resource must meet in order to be compliant. These conditions are based on industry standards and best practices. In addition, the Managed Cloud rules define the remediation actions that must be automatically triggered when an AWS resource violates a rule condition. |
| What is Managed Cloud rule violation?                        | A Managed Cloud rule defines a set of conditions based on industry standards and best practices. If an AWS resource becomes non-compliant with these conditions because of some configuration changes, the rule is violated. The rule violation automatically triggers pre-defined actions to make the AWS resource compliant again. |
| How are Managed Cloud rules different from the AWS Config rules? | Managed Cloud rules leverage the AWS Config rule mechanism to track configuration changes in AWS resources and evaluate if these changes violate any rule conditions. Based on this evaluation, Managed Cloud Services then takes the specified remediation action for the non-compliant resources. |
| How can I monitor the Managed Cloud rules?                   | You can use the **Managed Cloud Dashboard** in Dashboard Accelerator to monitor the Managed Cloud rules. |
| Is it possible to re-configure existing Managed Cloud rules? | Yes, you can contact the Managed Cloud Services team and request them to re-configure the Managed Cloud rules based on your requirements. |
| How do the users come to know about the violation of a specific Managed Cloud rule? | Managed Cloud rules send an email notification to specified email IDs based on the non-compliant resources that are present in AWS accounts. |
| What type of notification mechanisms do Managed Cloud rules support? | Managed Cloud rules currently support email as the notification mechanism. You receive an email each time a rule is violated and Managed Cloud Services takes remediation action to make the AWS resource compliant again. |
| Is there a possibility of manually enabling or disabling a specific Managed Cloud rule? | While onboarding a customer, the Managed Cloud Services team can enable only those Managed Cloud rules that meet your requirements. Also, rules that you no longer need can be disabled at a later stage. |

### <a id="resources-mnc" name="resources-mnc"></a>AWS resources (Managed Cloud Services)

| Question                                                     | Answer                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| What do you mean by compliant and non-compliant resources?   | A resource that meets all the conditions that are defined in the selected rules is compliant. Non-compliant resource violate at least one of the conditions in any of the selected rules. |
| How often does Managed Cloud Services check resources for compliance? | Managed Cloud Services runs all selected rules at periodic intervals to check for non-compliant AWS resources and then takes corrective actions. However, the rules are also triggered immediately in case of any configuration changes to an AWS resource during these intervals. |
| Can Managed Cloud Services monitor performance parameters of AWS resources? | No. Managed Cloud Services does not monitor the performance parameters for AWS resources. Existing monitoring solutions, such as AWS CloudWatch and Datadog, are integrated with Managed Cloud Services so that any alarms that are generated by these solutions are sent to Managed Cloud Services to perform remediation and notification actions. |
| What are the event sources supported by Managed Cloud Services? | Managed Cloud Services can receive events from multiple event sources but it primarily supports: AWS Config, AWS CloudWatch, and Datadog. |
