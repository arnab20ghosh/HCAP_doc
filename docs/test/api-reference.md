# <a id="api" name="api"></a>Test Accelerator API Reference

Hitachi Cloud Accelerator Platform - Test (Test Accelerator) provides a set of APIs (Application Programming Interface) for various components such as test jobs, providers, job scheduler, dashboard, and more. For example, you can use the RunTest APIs to get a list of all test jobs that are running, get job status, get a list of supported browsers, and submit test jobs.<br>

The API Reference is organized by components and provides information about the method, syntax, parameters, and response code for each API.
