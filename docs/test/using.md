## <a id="overview" name="overview"></a>Overview of tests

Test Accelerator provides the ability to automate the creation of test setups and perform different types of tests on your web application. This enables you to concentrate on the actual use cases of your application and reduce the time required to deliver the application.

Test Accelerator enables you to perform the following different types of tests:

- **URL test** -- This test can instantly check the availability of a web application on different browsers.
- **Security test** -- This test performs a security check of your web application by running different types of security packs on the application.
- **API test** -- This test covers the testing of the application programming interfaces (APIs) of your applications to determine if they meet the functionality, reliability, performance, and security expectations.
- **Automated (Cross Browser) test** -- This test automatically provisions machines with browsers of your choice and then runs your existing automation test suites in the selected browsers. 
- **Scale test** -- This test performs the scale testing of your web application across a range of browsers. It enables you to configure multiple browsers, the browser count to test the load, the automation test suite, and the run time in hours.
- **Manual test** -- This test quickly provisions Kubernetes pods with the selected browsers and reduces the effort to create test setups. You can concentrate on testing the actual use cases.
- **Infrastructure test** -- This test covers the testing of your IT infrastructure, such as servers, network switches, and routers. Test Accelerator supports the Serverspec, Inspec, Azure Spec, AWS Spec, and GCP Spec specification types.
- **Codeless Infra test** -- This test covers the testing of your AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud Platform (GCP) resources by using the default spec code that is provided by Test Accelerator. It saves time and resources spent on writing your own custom code.

_**Note:** The URL, manual, security, and codeless infra tests do not have a dependency on any automation test suite._

_**Note:** You can access Test Accelerator and perform various actions only if your Cloud Accelerator Platform administrator has granted you the appropriate permissions._

## <a id="custom-automated" name="custom-automated"></a>Customizing your automation code

Before you run the <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-test', viewPage: 'run-tests', viewSection: 'automated'})" style="text-decoration:none">automated (cross-browser) tests</a>, <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-test', viewPage: 'run-tests', viewSection: 'load'})" style="text-decoration:none">scale (load) tests</a>, or <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-test', viewPage: 'run-tests', viewSection: 'api'})" style="text-decoration:none">API tests</a> with your own automation code, perform the following procedures to customize your automation code:

- <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-test', viewPage: 'run-tests', viewSection: 'browser-support'})" style="text-decoration:none">Configure environment variables in your automation code</a>
- <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-test', viewPage: 'run-tests', viewSection: 'unique-data'})" style="text-decoration:none">Configure the use of unique data for each test run</a>

### <a id="browser-support" name="browser-support"></a>Configure environment variables in your automation code

To use Test Accelerator effectively, you must customize your automation code to use the environment variables that are exposed by Test Accelerator. Using these environment variables makes your automation code URL- and browser-independent and enables it to run on any environment without requiring changes to your code.

- **BROWSER**

  This environment variable enables you to run your automation code on the browsers that are selected while creating automated (cross-browser) or scale test jobs in Test Accelerator.<br>

  When the automated (cross-browser) or scale test job starts, the **Browsers** field value is exposed as the **BROWSER** environment variable, as shown below:

  ```
  BROWSER=firefox
  BROWSER=chrome
  ```
  
  To configure the browsers correctly, you must use this environment variable in your automation code, as shown in the following Java code example: 
  
  ```
  browser = System.getenv(Constants.BROWSER);
  ```
  
- **TEST_URL** 

  Each web application has a URL on which the automated (cross browser), scale test, or API test is run. This URL can change with time, environment, and many other factors. Each time the URL changes, you also need to update your automation code.<br>

  This environment variables enables you to run your automation code on the web application URL that is provided while creating automated (cross-browser), scale test, or API test jobs in Test Accelerator.<br>

  When the automated (cross-browser), scale test, or API test job starts, the **Application URL** field value is exposed as the **TEST_URL** environment variable, as shown below:

  ```
  TEST_URL=http://domain-name.com
  ```

  To configure the web application URL correctly, you must use this environment variable in your automation code, as shown in the following Java code example:

  ```
  test_url = System.getenv(Constants.TEST_URL);
  ```

  Using the **TEST_URL** environment variable makes your automation code URL-independent and enables it to run on any environment without requiring any changes to your code.

_**Note:** If you do not configure web drivers correctly, your tests might fail and you might not be able to use all features of Test Accelerator._

### <a id= "unique-data" name="unique-data"></a>Configure the use of unique data for each test run

In the case of automated (cross-browser) or scale tests, if you choose to run your automation code on multiple browsers, either sequentially or in parallel, you might want to use unique data for each execution. Test Accelerator exposes the **RUN_INDEX** environment variable, which has a unique incremental value for each browser.<br>

For example, if you are running tests on five browsers in parallel, the **RUN_INDEX** environment variable increments from 0 to 4 respectively for each browser:

```
RUN_INDEX=0     # Browser 1
RUN_INDEX=1     # Browser 2
RUN_INDEX=2     # Browser 3
...
...
...
RUN_INDEX=n-1   # Browser n
```

The following table lists a few scenarios in which you might need to use unique data for each execution. The table also describes how the **RUN_INDEX** variable might provide a solution in these scenarios.

| Scenario                                                     | Possible solution                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Use a different login credential set for each execution when running 10 browsers in parallel | Maintain a CSV file of multiple user-password pairs and use the **RUN_INDEX** value to fetch unique rows of credential pairs for each instance of your browser. |
| Select a different drop-down value for each execution        | Pass the **RUN_INDEX** value to the Select Drop-down method, which in turn selects a value based on the drop-down index. |
| Buy a unique product for every execution on an e-commerce website | Use the **RUN_INDEX** value as the locator index to buy different products in every instance of the browser. |

## <a id="url" name="url"></a>Running URL tests 

The URL test enables you to quickly test the availability of a web application by testing URL access to that application across various browsers. You must provide the application URL and the text that Test Accelerator must search for on the Home page of that application. The test passes only if Test Accelerator finds that text on the Home page.

1. On the Home page, click **New Test**.

2. In the Select Test window, click **URL Test**.

   The URL Test page appears, as shown in the following image.

   ![](/images/rean-test/rt_urltest.PNG)

### <a id="IO-aws" name="IO-aws"></a>Create the infrastructure test data file for AWS Spec

To run an infrastructure test with Default AWS Spec code, you must first create a JSON file that contains the test data.  Before you create a JSON file, see the list of <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-test', viewPage: 'run-tests', viewSection: 'resources'})" style="text-decoration:none">supported AWS resources</a> and <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-test', viewPage: 'run-tests', viewSection: 'aws-versions'})" style="text-decoration:none">AWS spec versions</a>.

#### Infrastructure JSON file

The following details are required to create the JSON file:

**Input**

This section contains the expected values that must be compared with the actual values that are retrieved for the resources defined in the **Output** section. 

A corresponding entry with the unique name specified in the **Output** section is configured in the **Input** section under the same resource type. Only the attributes defined in the **Input** section are compared with the actual state.

The resource type values in the **Input** section differ based on the version of the Default AWS Spec code. You can select one of the following options.

- Default AWS Spec code 1.3 and later

  In version 1.3, the resource type values are based on the Terraform resource names. For example, **aws_vpc** is the resource type under which VPC resources are defined. For details about the resource types that you must specify, see [Supported resources](https://reanplatform-help.reancloud.com/#/rean-platform-docs/accelerator?viewAccelerator=rean-test&viewPage=run-tests&viewSection=resources).

  Example JSON

  ```
  "input": {
    "aws_vpc": {
        "devVPC": {
            "cidr_block": "172.16.0.0/16",
            "tags": {
                "CreatedBy": "Deploy",
                "Name": "dev-datalake-quickstart-vpc",
                "Environment": "dev",
                "Owner": "a.g",
                "Product": "datalake-quickstart"
            },
            "enable_dns_support": true,
            "enable_dns_hostnames": true
        }
    }
  }
  ```

- Default AWS Spec code 1.2

  In version 1.2, the resource type values are based on custom types defined in Test Accelerator. For example, **VPC** is the resource type under which VPC resources are defined. For details about the resource types that you must specify, see [Resource types in Default AWS Spec code 1.2](https://reanplatform-help.reancloud.com/downloads/rean-test/Resource types in Default AWS Spec code 1.2.pdf).
  
  Example JSON

	```
	{
	    "VPC":{
		"vpc": {
		    "cidr_block": "10.0.0.0/16"
		}
	    },
	    "EC2": {
		"Demo_EC2_Instance": {
		    "instance_type": "t2.micro",
		    "tags": {
			"Name": "Platform-bastion-us-east-1b"
		    }
		}
	    }
	}
	```
	
	
	_**Note:** While Default AWS Spec code 1.3 is backward compatible and supports the older format of Input JSON, it is recommended that you switch to the latest format of Input JSON._

**Expected Output**

This section contains the names or IDs of all AWS resources that need to be validated.

Each key-value pair under each resource type represents the unique name of the resource and the corresponding ID of that resource. This ID is used to retrieve the attributes of the resource and validate them with the expected values defined in the **Input** section.

Example JSON

```
"output": {
    "aws_vpc": {
        "devVPC": "vpc-XXXXXXX",
        "prdVPC": "vpc-XXXXXXX"
    }
}
```

_**Note:** The resource type values in the **Output** section are based on the Terraform resource names. For example, in the above example, **aws_vpc** is used for the VPC resources._

### <a id="IO-gcp" name="IO-gcp"></a>Create the infrastructure test data file for GCP Spec

To run an infrastructure test with Default GCP Spec code, you must first create a JSON file that contains the test data. Before you create a JSON file, see the list of <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-test', viewPage: 'run-tests', viewSection: 'gcp-resources'})" style="text-decoration:none">supported GCP resources</a> and <a href="" ui-sref="rean-platform-docs.accelerator({viewAccelerator: 'rean-test', viewPage: 'run-tests', viewSection: 'gcp-versions'})" style="text-decoration:none">GCP Spec versions</a> supported by Test Accelerator.

#### Infrastructure JSON file

The following details are required to create the JSON file:

**Input:** This section contains the expected values that must be compared with the actual values that are retrieved for the resources defined in the **Output** section.

<u>Example JSON</u>

```json
 "input": {
    "google_compute_address": {
      "address": {
        "name": "ip-bastion-host",
        "description":"test gcpspec",
        "labels":{
          "owner":"hcap-test",
          "environment":"development"
        },
        "address":"10.0.0.26",
        "address_type":"INTERNAL",
        "purpose":"GCE_ENDPOINT",
        "network_tier":"PREMIUM",
        "subnetwork":"subnet-hv-hcap-dev-central",
        "region":"us-central1",
        "project":"hv-hcap-development"
      }
    }
  },
```

**Expected Output:** This section contains the names or IDs of all Azure resources that need to be validated.

<u>Example JSON</u>

```json
 "output": {
    "google_compute_address": {
      "address": "hcap-disk"
    }
  }
```
