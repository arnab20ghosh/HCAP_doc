# <a id="info-01" name="info-01"></a> Deploy Accelerator info byte 1: Product overview

Hitachi Cloud Accelerator Platform - Deploy (Deploy Accelerator) is a tool that enables you to easily design the IT infrastructure, generate infrastructure as code (IaC), and deploy and configure the infrastructure in the cloud securely, reliably, and consistently. It integrates with well-known cloud platforms (such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, and Microsoft Azure) and provides out-of-the-box support for the Chef and Puppet infrastructure automation tools.

## Why Deploy Accelerator

Deploy Accelerator offers the following key advantages to speed up the delivery of workloads in the cloud:

- **Automates deployment** of new and existing workloads or applications in the cloud
- **Reduces deployment time** and has a huge impact on time to value
- **Improves productivity** through prepackaged content (deployment blueprints and packages) that is based on industry standards
- **Simplifies cloud adoption** and reduces the need for subject-matter experts

## Key concepts in Deploy Accelerator

Before using Deploy Accelerator, understand the key concepts so that you can effectively design, deploy, and configure IT infrastructure in the cloud:

- **Providers** enable you to specify the cloud platform, the account in which the infrastructure must be deployed, and credentials for accessing that account.
- **Environments** help you to design the infrastructure that you need to deploy different solutions (or workloads) in the cloud.
- **Resources** are entities that you require to set up the infrastructure (for example, instances, VPCs, subnets, and security groups).
- **Packages** are entities that use the supported infrastructure automation tools to configure compute instances. Users can install, deploy, configure software and applications on compute instances by using packages.
